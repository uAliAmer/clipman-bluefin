✓ Clipman local hooks installed.

What this enabled:
  • commit-msg : aborts commits whose message contains an AI/Claude footprint
                 OR a trailer (Co-Authored-By:, Signed-off-by:, etc.) citing
                 a non-allowed account
  • pre-commit : aborts if your git identity is not on the personal allowlist,
                 or if the staged diff *adds* an AI footprint to a tracked
                 file (skips paths in HOOKS_PATH_ALLOWLIST, e.g. docs/hooks.md)
  • pre-push   : per-commit final check before commits leave the machine,
                 including a scan of diff additions (catches binaries +
                 commits made outside this hook chain)

Allowed account names (override via CLIPMAN_HOOKS_ALLOW="..."):
  MohammedEl-sayedAhmed

Uninstall:
  git config --unset core.hooksPath

Bypass once (NOT recommended):
